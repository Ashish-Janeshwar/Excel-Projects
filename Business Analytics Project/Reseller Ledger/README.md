A fully automated and scalable Excel-based ledger system designed to manage and monitor reseller transactions across months. Built to streamline financial reconciliation, dispute tracking, and balance summaries.

## 🔧 Purpose

This tool helps companies efficiently track balances for multiple resellers, auto-highlight disputes, and generate clean MIS-ready summaries — all within Excel.

Originally designed to replace a legacy system that used separate sheets per reseller, this new version unifies data into a dynamic structure, improving usability, accuracy, and processing speed.
